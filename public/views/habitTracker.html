          A family system helps every one of its members through the good and
          the bad times. People want to contact their families more frequently,
          but so often find themselves distracted by work and their busy
          schedules, ultimately detaching from their loved ones.

          <p>
            During my UX/UI Bootcamp at IronHack, I was proposed with a project

            <span>support building</span>, <span>or breaking</span>,
            <span>a habit</span>. Furthermore, to craft a new mobile app in only

            research.

          <h3>INTERVIEWS</h3>
          <p>
            Due to time constraints and scope of the challenge, I conducted
            <span>5 face-to-face interviews</span> with people who use their
            phones for more than <span>7 hours a day</span>. All participants
            are aged between 27-36, living in <span>Barcelona</span>.
          </p>
          <blockquote>Can you tell me about how you use your phone?</blockquote>
          <p>
            I began all interviews with the question above. From there I
            interviewed each participant for around <span>~15 minutes</span> to
            get down to their habits; thoughts; pain-points; even goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interviewing them helped me better learn first-hand what habits are
            there to support or cut on and ultimately how they feel about it. I
            gained insight to how they have difficulties balancing their
            relationships with their families and work; their feelings and
            emotions when it comes to reaching out to family; or even their need
            to be constantly reminded.

            Users were confused to where the sections of the Navigation bar at
            the bottom of the screen would take them. Some even said
            <i

              easy to use”</i

            users navigate around the app by using floating buttons on the top
            of the screen.

            Initially, the <span>‘Connections’</span> page was very confusing to

            Furthermore, users felt like this page does not resonate with the
            feel and concept of the App. Hence, I redesigned the whole UI of it
            and made it feel and look more pleasant and easy to use. Making the
            ‘Add’ button very clear, as well as changed each contact card to be
            easily read and visualized.

        <li>Due to time constraints and scope of the project brief, I only made a low hi-fi of the habit tracking app, therefore a main next step is to design and test the next launch as a full -hi-fi product.</li>
        <li>Research and design the Profile page of the prototype.</li>
        <li>Allow users to link social media accounts to make it easy to share their badges with their friends and network.</l>
        <li>Integrate the gamification aspect into the app to allow users to compete and engage with one another in the habit tracking app itself.</li>
