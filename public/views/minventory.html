          With the Mid-Fi ready, we began a usability testing sprint for three

          <span> 20 usability tests </span> we came across plenty of design
          faults and patterns that needed to be redesigned to meet user’s
          intuitions, familiarity, and wants. I decided to shed light to the

            We added the ability to save as a draft and conducted more testing,

            decided to not do a ‘Save as Draft’ feature and rely on the
            favorites and scheduling features, where users will then have the
            ability to come back to it.
